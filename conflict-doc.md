I am creating this file directly on GitHub. If I make a file with the same name in my local repo, via RStudio, before pulling this one, I will get a merge conflict.

I am editing this file on GitHub after resolving merge conflicts in RStudio. When I fetch and pull from upstream, I should see this addition.

I am making yet another change to the upstream repo (on GitHub)

Now I'm making another (GitHub, upstream) text addition at the end of the document. I have not removed any text. Now I'm adding a bit more text in the same place in another commit.
